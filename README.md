## ðŸ§ª E2E Automation Testing with Cypress + Cucumber ðŸ¥’
Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm using this repo to show how I automate UI testing using Cypress and Cucumber. I'm testing a real web app, SauceDemo, which is perfect for practicing login flows and checkout processes.

I've also hooked everything up to Jenkins, so the tests run automatically.

## ðŸŽ¯ Whatâ€™s This All About?
This project is about automating tests for a fake e-commerce site (SauceDemo) using Cypress and Cucumber.

I picked SauceDemo because it has:

1. A login page
2. A product catalog
3. Checkout flow

## ðŸ§  What Iâ€™m Testing
Hereâ€™s what the automation covers:
1. âœ… Login Feature â€” Valid and invalid logins
2. ðŸ›’ Checkout Process â€” Adding items to cart, filling out checkout info, and placing the order

These features represent typical user behavior, so theyâ€™re great to test.

## ðŸ”§ Tools Iâ€™m Using
1. Cypress â€“ My go-to JavaScript testing tool for UI automation
2. Cypress Cucumber Preprocessor â€“ So I can write tests in plain English (Gherkin syntax)
3. Jenkins â€“ For running tests automatically in CI/CD pipelines
4. SauceDemo â€“ A safe playground for testing e-commerce flows
